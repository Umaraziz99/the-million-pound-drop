Project:
An implementation of the show Million Pound Drop

Report:
- well written and detailed, some typos

Code:
- works fine. 
- The only glitch is 1e+06 instead of 1000000. This was SO EASY to fix! On line 179, just use 
    
    set(handles.Bal,'string',num2str(balance));

  instead of 

    set(handles.Bal,'string',balance);

  In this way, balance remains a numerical object, but the appearance in the text box is a string. 
- professional use of Github, with full use of its functionality. I'm puzzled by what you say in the report about syncing and overwriting: yes, before working on a branch you have to sync it! Then you make changes. Each branch should be one new feature.
